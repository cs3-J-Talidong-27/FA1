	    <h1>This is Badminton</h1>
		<h2> Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.</h2>
		<h2> Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).</h2>
		<h2>Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.</h2>
		<h2> The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. </h2>
